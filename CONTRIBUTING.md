## Pull Requests

1. You should **never** commit anything to master no matter how small.
    Instead fork or checkout your own branch and make the appropiate changes and
    submit a Pull Request. This is to preserve the master branch
    with *stable* and *approved* code.
2. You may not merge in your **own** Pull Request without the approval of another developer.
3. Pull Requests should have a descriptive title and a detailed body explaining
    the issue you set out to fix and how you decided on your changes.

## Coding Style

### General

Everything lives inside the **bwa** namespace

### File Naming

* All file names must be in **snake_case** with the exception of assets and dependencies.
* C++ header files must end in *.hpp*, **not** *.h*, the file extension *.h* should only
    be used when programming in *C*.
* C++ source files must end in *.cpp*
* Lua files must end in *.lua*, even if the Lua interpreter does not enforce this.

### Includes

Header files should be included in the following format in **alphabetical order**
```cpp
/*
    External libraries must be included first.
    Notice how they are in alphabetical order.
*/
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>
#include <SFML/Network.hpp>
#include <sol.hpp>
#include <TGUI/TGUI.hpp>

...

/*
    C++ standard headers must come after any external
    library headers. Again notice the order.
*/
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
#include <type_traits>
#include <utility>

...

/*
    C standard headers must come after any C++
    standard headers. I recommend using the C++
    equivalent. For example ctime instead of time.h
*/
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

...


/*
    Lastly any header files local to the project must go last.
    Don't forget to include them in alphabetical order.
*/
#include "local_file.hpp"
#include "local_file2.hpp"
#include "local_other.hpp"
```
