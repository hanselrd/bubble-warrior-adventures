Script Notes:  No one knows who the Hero is
Hero begins game in small room at back of castle, next to a bed.  

"*knock knock*"
Castle_npc1 enters.  
"Here you are!  What are you doing lazing about back here?  General Tiren is waiting for you in the main hall.  Go.  Go!"
First time entering the main hall:
"Ah, there you are.  On behalf of the entire council, allow me to offer you my thanks.  I never thought I would live to see the Prophecies come true, and now to be able to witness this with my own eyes...  Well.  I wish it hadn't come to this, but I'm more grateful than I can possibly express."  
Slight pause, General Tiren comes forward and shakes the hero's hand, then steps back again.  
"The city is under curfew.  I've ordered my people to stand down; the square should be empty.  Is there anything else you need?"
Hero shakes their head and raises an arm.  A bright light pulses out from their hand, then subsides.  
The general nods their head.  
"We'll keep the castle doors open as long as we can.  If you need to, you can always return to rest up before continuing.  Good luck ...Hero."

*After the boss is defeated*
General Tiren:  "Hero, I...  You have exceeded my every expectation.  On behalf of the council, and our entire kingdom, thank you.  If there's anything I can do-"
Jaime:  "Actually, there is."
General Tiren looks shocked.  The player should be shocked too - the hero hasn't spoken until now.  The player character removes their helmet.  
General Tiren:  "But you're-"
Jaime:  "WHEW.  Gods it's hot under there."
"Alright.  I need two things from you.  I need a travel pass for Isterland, the guards wouldn't let me past our borders last time and I don't want to have to try to sneak past them.  Can you get me one?"
General Tiren:  "I-I can arrange to one sent to the crossing point, if that's-  I mean-"
Jaime:  "Awesome!  Alright I'm off then."
They go to leave.  
General Tiren:  "Wait!  You...  You said two things?"
Jaime:  "Oh, right."  They turn around and toss something at the General.  Tiren catches it, and it glows brightly in their hand.  
"Can you see that the bubble is taken back to the shrine?  Ellene would box my ears off if I tried to take it back myself."
They turn around and walk almost out the door.
"Thanks!  Good luck with everything, it's been a pleasure."
They leave.  General Tiren is left in the middle of the hall holding the great bubble in their hand.  
General Tiren:  "But they were barely more than a child!  How on earth did they get their hands on the Great Bubble when our best soldiers had failed?"  
The bubble glows in their hand, and we fade out.
