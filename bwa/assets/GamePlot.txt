Prologue:  
Game starts off with hero waking up inside of the castle in the back room.  There should be various NPCs around that you can speak with in order to get some backstory on the game.  Plot points revealed here:
-The kingdom is surrounded by a large mountain range, with the only trade route coming through a pass from the south
-A recent earthquake caused a rockslide that damaged one of the surrounding mountains and led to the roc nesting grounds being destroyed.  As a result the rocs are rampaging, and have started attacking the castle.  
-The hero has found an acient artifact known as the Great Bubble and is going to be using it to kill or drive away the rocs.  
-The hero is only 16 years old and is the niece/nephew of the guardian of the Great Bubble, which is responsible for protecting their kingdom
-Brief explanation of bubbles, spread out over a couple of (required) NPCs
-Learn that the armor they're wearing was specially requested by the player
-Travel between nations can be difficult, you basically need to either be super rich or have powerful connections
Eventually the player will head to the front of the castle.  Important NPC [needs a name] will meet the player there and ask if they're sure, etc.  Seems almost doubtful.  Is upset because they lost a lot of good people to these birds and haven't been able to make a dent in them.  Player character is confident, almost cocky.  General doesn't understand how they're going to manage to attack the birds, they've been staying out of longbow range, but hero is confident.  Reminds general of their bargain.  (Or maybe this bit should happen later)

Player goes outside.  Has a brief moment of indecision with himself, then finally steps out onto the main road.  There should be soldiers standing nearby blocking off the side streets and keeping people inside.  Will be 1-2 small fights and then one big one.  This is the player's introduction to combat.  After the first fight is done, hero should have a moment to themself to think how awesome the Great Bubble is and how their plan is working.  Fights should be tuned so that the smaller mobs go down in only a few hits.  This is basically a tutorial so that the player learns how to swing their sword, etc, without really risking dying.  Great Bubble should have damage reduction, damage dealt increased, HP drain, and faster attack speed - something ridiculously OP.  The EXP bar on the bubble should be almost but not quite full.  

When the hero reaches the main square, the boss fight will begin in earnest.  This will be a larger roc, maybe 2x the size of the others.  Should swoop across the square, forcing the hero to run out of the way or be hit.  After 3 swoops or so, it should land and start to peck.  Hero can then fight in earnest.  Fight should still be relatively easy for the player to win.  (Conversely, we could not have this fight at all, and simply have the scene shift as the player approaches the square.  For example, the player approaches, you see the shadow of the roc, the player lifts the Bubble high and the camera pans up, and then it fades out as a brilliant white light shines out.  Then fade in on the next day).  

The next day (or later that night?  Whatever) there is a ceremony in the main castle hall.  The king/queen present the hero with a travel pass, allowing them to travel beyond the borders.  This is super exciting for the hero, because they've dreamed of becoming an adventurer and traveling and now they can.  They head to the door where the general (and maybe a few other people) are waiting.  They chat briefly about their plans, the hero starts to leave, then pauses and turns back to the general.  He gives the general the Great Bubble and asks him to see that it's returned to the shrine that he got it from.  (He promised his relative that he would see that it was returned, since it's vital to protecting the kingdom, but the hero really wants to get going and doesn't want to have to go back.)  So he gives the Bubble to the general and asks him to return it for him, and to tell his uncle about a crack in the western wall from the earthquake.  Then he's off!
After the hero leaves, the general thinks to himself a bit, then looks at the Great Bubble and says something along the lines of "Wait, is that...?"  or whatever.  He has a moment of realization.  Then the camera pans out and the title screen plays.
