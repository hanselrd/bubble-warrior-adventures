## Synopsis
This project was created for our Software Engineering course. We were tasked with
creating a **PowerPoint** presentation detailing what our project was about,
how the work would be split up and a guideline to follow. With the freedom given
to us to choose our programming language and project we settled on using *C++* with a
bit of *[Lua](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3)* for simple scripting and a 
role-playing game. We are using *[SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)*
to handle window events, graphics and audio. We are currently working on the story
to go with the game.

## Motivation
Hmm, we didn't know you needed any motivation to create a game, but here goes!
Video games have always been a passion of ours. They're natural stress relievers
and who doesn't love a good storyline?

## Development Environment
We are using [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads), but since our libraries are
cross-platform, you can easily use any editor and/or operating system. **Makefile not included!**

## Installation
Clone the repo by pasting the following command in your terminal.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanselrd/bubble-warrior-adventures --recursive
```
Then navigate to the newly created **bubble-warrior-adventures** folder and double-click
the **.sln** file. Currently we do not support any other operating systems other
than Windows for development.
